## CHI test example 1

#### Research question
Is there any association between gender and the amount of physical activity?

The Chi-square test of independence test is used to determine whether gender and the amount of
physical activity are likely to be related or not.

#### Hypothesis
- Null hypothesis: The gender and level of physical activity are independent of each other
- Alternate hypothesis: The levels of physical activity are dependent on gender

#### Assumptions
The chi-squared test is only valid if all expected counts are >= 5

#### Decision of test
We observe the p value of the chi-squared to decide the outcome of the test.
- We reject the null hypothesis if the p value is <= 0.05.
- We do not reject the null hypothesis if the p value is > 0.05.
