## Two-sample t-test

#### The two-sample t-test is used to determine if the means of two sets of data are significantly different fromeach other or not.

We will use the below example for illustration purposes.

Let A1 nd A2 denote a set obtained by drawing a random sample of six measurements:

A1 = {30.02, 29.99, 30.11, 29.97, 30.01, 29.99}

A2 = {29.89, 29.93, 29.97, 29.98, 30.02, 29.98}

A1 and A2 are the weights of screws that were produced by two different machines.

##### Hypothesis
- Null hypothesis: There is no difference between the average weights of screws produced by two different machines A1 and A2.
H0 : µA1 = µA2
- Alternate hypothesis, Ha: There is a difference between the average weights of screws produced by two different machines A1 and A2
Ha : µA1 ̸= µA2

##### Assumptions
For two-sample t-test, the following assumptions should be met:
- The sample means being compared for two populations follow normal distribution.
- The two samples are from populations with equal/same variances.

##### Decision
At significance level of 0.05,
- Reject null hypothesis if p value < 0.05
- Do not Reject null hypothesis if p value > 0.05
