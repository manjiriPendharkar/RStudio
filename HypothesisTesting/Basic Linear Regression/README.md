## Basic Linear Regression Test

#### The code reads the files A1_Ex3_signif.csv and A1_Ex3_not_signif.csv and tests for linear hypothesis.
#### Variables include x and y

#### The full linear regression test can be called with a function `mytest(file_name)`, which calls other functions and outputs a nicely formatted report.
#### The structure of the test is:
1. State the Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis
2. Check the assumptions, plotting 
   (a) y vs x, 
   (b) the scatter plot of the regression residuals vs the fitted values 
   (c) the histogram of the regression residuals 
3. Perform the linear regression and report the values of the estimated slope, the 95% CIs, the value of t, the degree of freedom df, and the p-value.
4. Write the “decision” of the test, either rejection or not rejection of the Null Hypothesis, at 5% significance level.
