# Images

Let's include a preview of the cheatsheet we mentioned before (you can find it [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)).

```{r cheatsheet, fig.align='center', out.width="80%", fig.cap = "RMarkdown cheatsheet", echo=FALSE, fig.pos = "h"}
knitr::include_graphics("cheatsheet.png")
```

# Tables

Tables could be generated using `kable()` or `kbl()`. Short table can also be created within `R` by using `tibble::tribble`.

```{r kbl-example, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- tribble(~ `First Header`, ~ `Second Header`,
               "Content Cell 1", "Content Cell 2",
               "Content Cell 3", "Content Cell 4")
dat %>% 
  kbl(booktabs = TRUE, caption = "kable example") %>% 
  kable_styling(position = "center", latex_options = "hold_position")
```
And see Table \@ref(tab:kbl-example)

```{r k, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
dt <- mtcars[1:5, 1:6]
dt

kbl(mtcars[1:8, 1:4], booktabs = T, linesep = "")

kbl(dt, booktabs = T) %>%
kable_styling() %>%
add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Group 1" = 2,
"Group 2" = 2, "Group 3" = 2))


```

# Cross-referencing

We are going to typeset the following as an example. Most cross-referencing are obtained with `\@ref()`.
   
Let $\mu_t = \hat{y}_t = l_{t-1} + b_{t-1}$ denote the one-step forecast of $y_t$ assuming we know the values of all parameters. Also let $\epsilon_t= y_t -\mu_t$ denote the one-step forecast error at time $t$. Then
\begin{equation}
y_t = l_{t-1} + b_{t-1} + \epsilon_t, (\#eq:eq1)
\end{equation}

and so we can write

\begin{align}
l_t &= l_{t-1}+b_{t-1}+\alpha\epsilon_t (\#eq:eq2)\\
b_t &= b_{t-1} + \beta^* \left(l_t - l_{t-1} - b_{t-1}\right) = b_{t-1} + \alpha\beta^* \epsilon_t. (\#eq:eq3)
\end{align}

We simplify the last expression by setting $\beta = \alpha \beta^*$. The three equations above, i.e. Equations \@ref(eq:eq1)--\@ref(eq:eq3), constitute a state space model underlying Holt’s method. The model is fully specified once we state the distribution of the error term $\epsilon_t$. Usually we assume that these are independent and identically distributed, following a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance $\sigma^2$, which we write as $\epsilon_t \sim NID(0, \sigma^2)$.
  
On a completely unrelated note, you can cross-reference to figures and tables as Figure \@ref(fig:cheatsheet) and Table \@ref(tab:kbl-example).
