## Visualising Programme for International Student Assessment Records 

#### The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is an international assessment measuring student performance in reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.
PISA assesses the extent to which 15-year-old students have acquired some of the knowledge and skills that are essential for full participation in society, and how well they are prepared for lifelong learning in the areas of reading, mathematical and scientific literacy.
In 2018, PISA involved 79 countries and 600,000+ students worldwide. 

The records for a subset of countries are saved in the pisa_2018.csv file and contain the following variables:
|variable| class    |description                   |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
|country |character |Country 3 character code      |
|gender  |character |Gender of the student         |
|math    |double    |Simulated score in mathematics| 
|read    |double    |Simulated score in reading.   |
|science |double    |Simulated score in science    |
