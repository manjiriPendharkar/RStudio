## Hypothesis Testing

### Aim
The main aim of this report is to conduct an exploratory and statistical tests analysis to see if there is any evidence of a relationship between the variables height, weight, gender and levels of physical activity using project2022.csv dataset containing observations of men and women aged 26-45. 

### Research questions
In this statistical report, we provide answers to the following research questions:

1. Is there a linear relationship between height and weight?

Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between X = height and Y = weight, by fitting a linear equation to see whether we can predict weight of a person by their height.

2. Is the mean height of male and female the same?

In this scenario, we assume equal variances between male and female heights. Since we assume equal variances, we have conducted two sample t-test to investigate whether gender has an effect on average heights of males and females.

3. Is there any association between gender and the amount of physical activity?

The Chi-square test of independence test is used to determine whether gender and the amount of physical activity are likely to be related or not


### Datatset
In this report, project2022.csv dataset is used to answer research questions defined above.
The datset contains observations of men and women aged 26-45 with information on the following variables:
- ID
- Gender
- Height (in cm)
= Weight (in kg)
- Physical Activity (None, Moderate, Intense)
